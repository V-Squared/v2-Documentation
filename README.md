# Installing JRE

## Avoid Oracle JRE!
We had really bad experiences with JRE from Oracle, by means of messing up our search engines and make it really hard to use Google Search engine again. On top of it the Oracle JRE had severe security breaches. Ubuntu had similar experiences and no longer support Oracle JRE but instead Open JDK.

Go to this [website](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/) and download the .gz file for ubuntu.
