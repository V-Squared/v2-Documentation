# Current Use
Due to the two very big limitations:

 1. You can only work on one document at a time
 2. No revision management with GitHub


# Strengths


# Feel
So far the feel is very good

# Tests
## Table support with GitHub

| Item     | Value | Qty   |
| :------- | ----: | :---: |
| Computer | $1600 |  5    |
| Phone    | $12   |  12   |
| Pipe     | $1    |  234  |


# Limitations
## Can only have one document open
Every time I open a new instance of StackEdit it will close the other instance. This means I can not have several text edits open the same time. Quite a limitation in my workflow, as I frequently write on many documents the same time. According to → https://github.com/benweet/stackedit/issues/10 this is by design. Since the early nineties I am not used to this limitation anymore. This post confirms the same limitation with a workaround: → http://www.sitepoint.com/stackedit-4-0-multiple-instances-local-hosting/

## No Conflict Handling with GitHub
I made a change with the GitHub Editor first and then with the stackedit editor. The changes made with GitHub Editor were overwritten by the StackEdit Editor. Not really a good implementation. There should be at least a warning and better there should be a merge proposal.
