## Can only have one document open
Every time I open a new instance of StackEdit it will close the other instance. This means I can not have several text edits open the same time. Quite a limitation in my workflow, as I frequently write on many documents the same time. According to → https://github.com/benweet/stackedit/issues/10 this is by design. Since the early nineties I am not used to this limitation anymore. This post confirms the same limitation with a workaround: → http://www.sitepoint.com/stackedit-4-0-multiple-instances-local-hosting/
